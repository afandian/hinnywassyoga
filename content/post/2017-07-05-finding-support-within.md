In this week’s classes we’ve been working with the intent of finding the support you need inside.

Using two simple actions, grounding down and taking a full breath, it’s possible to tap into an internal strength which can help you through any challenges you face. This might be a yoga pose, or a delayed train, or an argument, or grief, or just the mild trauma of Sainsbury’s on a Saturday. Whatever the adversity, this simple formula can help you respond as your wiser self, and connect to your immense internal support system. If my first response when I feel in need is to look inwards, not outwards to food or tv or other people, then I feel much more steady, and in a better position to ask for ouside help if I do need it.

 - When you feel in need of support, begin by sending your focus into all the parts of your body which are in contact with the ground. Fully feel what it is to be supported by the earth.
 - Then take a full, soft, feeling breath into your low belly. Nourish yourself with your breath.
 - As you exhale, feel for letting go of anything that’s not useful to you - that might be tension in your shoulders or belly, or self-mutilating talk, or an old story you tell yourself about your limitations.

Hope you find this as useful as I do.
