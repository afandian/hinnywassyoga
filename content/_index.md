It is a powerful tool for change and growth, and no matter how fit, how bendy, how strong you are I'm certain you'll find that life is always better with yoga in it!</p>

<h1>Who is Hinny Wass?</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7">
<p>Hinny is a certified Level Two Forrest Yoga Teacher, based in Oxford. She first discovered Forrest Yoga, under the expert teaching of Forrest Yoga Guardian Jambo Truong, while living in Newcastle upon Tyne.  At the time she was working full time as a violinist and violin teacher, and found that Forrest Yoga was an excellent way of easing the aches and pains resulting from her work.  </p>
 
<p>As Hinny continued to practise Forrest Yoga, she discovered that it was also the route to becoming stronger than she’d ever imagined she could be, feeling more balanced both in body and in mind, to healing physical discomforts and emotional scar tissue, to learning how to live with more grace and make better choices, and to becoming part of a wonderful, intelligent and fiercely kind community - the international Forrest Yoga tribe.  She is very excited to share this unique and wonderful form of yoga with you, and to help you experience its myriad benefits. </p>
 
<p>In Hinny’s classes you can expect to feel supported, safe and encouraged.  You will be given all the help you need so you can practise yoga in a way which is healing, comfortable, strengthening, revelatory, mindful and transformative.</p>  
 
<p>In her spare time Hinny enjoys feeling the sunshine on her skin, reading spy novels, knitting socks, and dancing, though she has much less spare time these days since her most beloved son was born. Hinny has an MA in linguistics, specialising in syntax.  </p>
