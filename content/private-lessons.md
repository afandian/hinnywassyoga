Hinny also offers one-to-one tuition in your home.  You just need to provide a warm room with space for two yoga mats, and Hinny can bring everything else you&rsquo;ll need.  For prices and more information email **hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk**.

Private lessons are excellent for: those who prefer practising yoga at home rather than in public classes; those who can&rsquo;t find a class at a time that suits them; and people who have a particular injury or issue they want to address.  A private lesson offers you the chance of asking as many questions as you like, and of receiving focussed, detailed guidance in your yoga practice, plus lots of hands-on assists to help you find best alignment.
